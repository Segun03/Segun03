ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some projects I've worked on:

Pupils Management System: This program is a simple Pupils Database Management System written in C. It focuses on managing student records including registration numbers, names, and grades. Users can add new student records. Registration numbers are generated automatically while names and grades are entered by the user. Existing records can be viewed. The program stores and retrieves records from a text file (student_records.txt).

Guessing Game: The Guessing Game is a fun and interactive program where users are prompted to guess a number within a specified range. The program notifies the user about the number of available trials and provides feedback based on their guesses. The winning number is randomly generated each time the game is played.

Poultry-Farm Management System: This software is designed to efficiently manage the operations of a small poultry farm. Its primary functions encompass key activities such as registering the production of livestock, facilitating point of sale transactions with automated receipt generation, and enabling tracking of livestock mortality rates. With intuitive features tailored to the needs of poultry farmers, this software streamlines record-keeping, enhances sales processes, and provides valuable insights for better farm management.
